📱 Mobile Development with React Native
Introduction

Mobile development has evolved significantly over the years, with frameworks and tools that enable developers to build high-quality, cross-platform applications efficiently. One such powerful combination is React Native, TypeScript, NativeWindCSS, and the Expo Framework.

This stack allows developers to create performant, scalable, and visually appealing mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms — from a single codebase.

In this section, we’ll explore how to get started with mobile development using these technologies, their benefits, and how they work together seamlessly.

⚛️ What is React Native?

React Native is an open-source framework developed by Meta (Facebook) for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React.

It allows developers to:

Write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android.

Use native components, ensuring apps feel truly native.

Achieve high performance comparable to native Swift/Kotlin apps.

💡 Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language.
Using TypeScript in React Native projects provides key benefits:

✅ Catch errors during development (before runtime).

📘 Improve code readability and maintainability.

⚡ Boost developer productivity with better tooling and autocomplete.

🏗️ Scale your application more effectively as it grows in complexity.

🎨 What is NativeWindCSS?

NativeWindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework for React Native — inspired by TailwindCSS.

It allows you to style your components directly in JSX using class names such as:

<View className="flex-1 justify-center items-center bg-blue-500">
  <Text className="text-white text-lg font-bold">Hello World</Text>
</View>

Benefits:

✨ Maintain a consistent design system.

💅 Write styles directly in your components.

🌓 Built-in support for responsive design and dark mode.

🧩 Reduce boilerplate and avoid verbose StyleSheet objects.

🚀 Why Use Expo?

Expo is a framework and platform built on top of React Native that simplifies the development process.

It offers tools and services for building, deploying, and managing React Native apps without the need for complex native setup.

Key Benefits:

⚙️ Quick setup: Expo handles all native configurations.

📱 Expo Go: Instantly preview your app on real devices.

🧱 Pre-built APIs: Access camera, notifications, maps, sensors, etc.

🔁 Over-the-air updates: Push updates instantly without App Store resubmission.

🧰 Getting Started
1. Set Up Your Environment

Make sure you have:

Node.js v16+

Expo CLI

npm install -g expo-cli


VS Code (recommended)

2. Create a New Expo Project with TypeScript
npx create-expo-app MyApp
cd MyApp

3. Run the App
npx expo start


Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone or launch the app on an emulator.
